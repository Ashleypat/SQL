# United States County Level Income Response to Corporate   Taxation and Attractiveness Index of  the Counties
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive database and analytical framework for evaluating the impact of corporate tax policies on household income distribution across various counties in a state. The primary goal is to provide a robust SQL-based solution that enables state government officials and policymakers to analyze how different corporate tax policies influence household incomes at a granular level.
**Database Schema Desig**n: Developed a normalized database schema to efficiently store and manage data related to corporate tax policies, household incomes, and county-specific economic indicators.
**Data Integration**: Integrated diverse datasets from multiple sources, including tax records, census data, and economic reports, to provide a holistic view of the impact of corporate tax policies.
**Analytical Framework**: Implemented a suite of SQL queries and stored procedures to analyze the relationship between corporate tax policies and household income distribution across counties.
**Reporting and Visualization**: Created views and materialized views to facilitate easy extraction and visualization of insights, supporting decision-making processes.
**Performance Optimization**: Optimized database performance through indexing, query optimization, and efficient data storage practices.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of the database schema, data integration process, and analytical queries to ensure ease of use and maintainability.
